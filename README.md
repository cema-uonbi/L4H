# Livestock programming for nutritional improvements in children under five years of age and pregnant and lactating mothers (L4H)

The Livestock for Health (L4H) project is a collaborative effort between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Marsabit County Government, the National Government of Kenya, the National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) and Washington State University (WSU), with funding from the Office of Technical and Program Quality, Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

The aim of the project was to determine the cost-effectiveness of livestock feeding interventions and nutritional counselling in reducing the risk of malnutrition among children and women in pastoral communities during the critical dry periods.

The project was conducted for a 2-year period, from September 2019 to December 2021. The study site was Laisamis subcounty, in Marsabit County.

The project was designed as a cluster randomized control trial with two intervention arms and one control group where:
 - Intervention arm 1: Households received livestock feeds sufficient to maintain two tropical livestock units (TLUs) for 90 days during critical dry periods or drought and 7–14 days into the rain season
 - Intervention arm 2: Households received similar livestock feeds and enhanced nutritional counselling carried out by trained community healthcare workers
 - Intervention arm 3 (control group): Households did not receive any of the two interventions during the study period.
 
The tropical livestock unit (TLU) is a measure of standardizing livestock. Two TLUs is equivalent to two cows, two camels, twentry goats, or twenty sheep. Two kgs of feed were given to a TLU per day during the critical dry periods. The graphic below summarizes the required feed consumption per TLU for the households in intevention arms one and two.

The baseline survey was conducted, followed by routine household data collection visits (six week follow-up and quarterly household visits) for monitoring trends in household milk yield, milk consumption (amount and frequency) and nutritional status across the intervention and control arms of the study over the study period. At baseline, both the intervention and control arms were comparable in household demographics, socio-economic characteristics, household livestock ownership, milk production and consumption, and maternal and child nutritional status and health. Additionally, the high prevalence of malnutrition in this study population and the data on health and intervention costs which will be collected in this study will allow for a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine if livestock feeding interventions and nutritional counselling are cost-effective in reducing the risk of malnutrition among children and women in pastoral communities during the critical dry periods.
