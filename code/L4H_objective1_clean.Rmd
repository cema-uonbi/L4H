## Study setting

## Study design and participants

## Data collection

To understand the household milk yield in litres and the factors associated with it, we collected periodic data on the household demographics, socio-demographics, herd size (milk and non-milking), herd dynamics (births), veterinary interventions, periods of expected droughts, period the household received the intervention of feed, and the amount of milk produced at a household level. The data was collected every six weeks, from September 2019 till December 2021. Baseline data was collected during the first six weeks of the study period. 

## Data analysis

We carried out descriptive analysis by assessing the daily milk yield for households in both the intervention and control arms for the different seasons (critical dry periods and non-dry seasons). The milk yield was also assessed for the different animal species, and the tropical livestock unit (TLU) at a household level. The tropical livestock unit is a way of standardising comparison of animals where one cow/camel represents 10 goats/ sheep. The animal births for each species were also calculated during the study period.

To assess the factors associated with milk yield at  a household level, we carried out a mixed effects multivariate analysis. A univariate model as conducted for variables that included the period a household received feed, number of milked and non-milked TLUs, number of births, number of people in the household, whether the household herds received any veterinary intervention, the occupation of the household head, and the socio-economic index. Variables that had a P value of <0.2 were included in the mixed effects multivariate model which employed a gaussian distribution. The household identification number and number of days since the household was recruited into the study were used as fixed effects.

The socio-economic index was calculated using assets collected during the study period which included ownership of a mobile phone (household head), small electronics (e.g. radio), large electronics (e.g. television), simple transport (e.g. bicycle), large transport (e.g. motorbike), main source of lighting, main toilet facility, main material for external roofind, exterior walls and floor. Principal component analysis using the singular value decomposition method which assesses correlations between individuals was implemented. Factor score for each variable during each visit was calculated. Quantiles for each visit were used to categorise households into five quantiles, ranging from quantile 1 (highest)to quantile 5 (lowest).
